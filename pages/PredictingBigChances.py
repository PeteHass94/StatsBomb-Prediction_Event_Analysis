Welcome to the **Big Chance Predictor** - an interactive football analytics app powered by **StatsBomb Open Data** and **XGBoost**.

This tool breaks matches into 10-minute segments, recalculating time to run from **0 to 100 minutes** instead of two halves. 
Each segment is analyzed for attacking momentum using binned and rolling stats like:
- Expected Goals (xG)
- Final third passes and carries
- Box passes and carries

You can:
- üß† Train models to predict big chances *before they happen*
- ‚öΩ Explore individual matches through shot maps and carry/passing plots
- üîç Customize thresholds and time intervals for your analysis

Use the sidebar to begin by selecting a competition and team!

    - **Feature Engineering**: We use historical context ‚Äî cumulative xG, passes, and carries ‚Äî up to that bin.
    - **Target Labels**: The label is whether a big chance occurs in the **next** time bin.
    - **Train/Test Split**: Matches are split 80/20 **by match ID** to prevent data leakage.
    - **Model Level**: Training is done **per-bin**, but results are summarized **per match** to keep them interpretable.

    Use the results to identify patterns in team momentum, early signs of defensive vulnerability, or consistent attacking intent across matches.
